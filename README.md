To run, open a terminal window and run server.py using python3. Then, in a separate terminal window, use python3 to run client.py. 
Follow the instructions as provided in the program. On exit, the client connection will close out and the server will continue running.
Rerun the client.py file using python3 to reconnect to the server.

If you receive a binding error when running the server.py program, change the port number in the server.py and client.py files
to another five-digit number. Then run again.
